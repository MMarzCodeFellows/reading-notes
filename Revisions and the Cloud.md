# **Revisions and the Cloud**
In this software development process we are learning revisions and the cloud. Before we focus just on those two topics let's build up some fundamental concepts.

How do we start coding changes on our basic computers, desktops, and lab tops as computer users?

First we look for a platform to do that with. 

# **Git -Version Contol System vs Revisions for Programmers** 

- Wikipedia defines Git as, "distributed version control system that tracks changes in any set of computer files, usually used for coordinating work among programmers." at [https://github.com/MMarzCodeFellows/reading-notes/edit/main/README.md](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git)
 - "As with most other distributed version control systems, and unlike most clientâ€“server systems, every Git directory on every computer is a full-fledged repository with complete history and full version-tracking abilities," (Wikipedia, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git edited 01.01.2024).
- One way to download Git is via computer downloads quick and easy like at [(https://github.com/MMarzCodeFellows/reading-notes/edit/main/README.md)](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- Code Fellows uses Git as a training tool for us new coders learning basic coding skills. One guide suggested by Code Fellows is the Git Tutorial Guide at [https://github.com/MMarzCodeFellows/reading-notes/blob/main/MarkDown.md](https://blog.udemy.com/git-tutorial-a-comprehensive-guide/)

# **Other Platforms combined with Git**

What is Version Control?

What is cloning in Git?

What is the command to track and stage files?

What is the command to take a snapshot of your changed files?

What is the command to send your changed files to Github?

What is this used for?
