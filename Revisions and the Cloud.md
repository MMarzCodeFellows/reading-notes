# **Revisions and the Cloud**
In this software development process we are learning revisions and the cloud. Before we focus just on those two topics let's build up some fundamental concepts.

How do we start coding changes on our basic computers, desktops, and lab tops as computer users?

First we look for a platform to do that with. 

# **Git -Version Contol System vs Revisions for Programmers**

- Wikipedia defines Git as, "distributed version control system that tracks changes in any set of computer files, usually used for coordinating work among programmers." at [https://github.com/MMarzCodeFellows/reading-notes/edit/main/README.md](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git)
 - "As with most other distributed version control systems, and unlike most client–server systems, every Git directory on every computer is a full-fledged repository with complete history and full version-tracking abilities," (Wikipedia, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git edited 01.01.2024).
- One way to download Git is via computer downloads quick and easy like at [(https://github.com/MMarzCodeFellows/reading-notes/edit/main/README.md)](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- Code Fellows uses Git as a training tool for us new coders learning basic coding skills. One guide suggested by Code Fellows is the Git Tutorial Guide at [https://github.com/MMarzCodeFellows/reading-notes/blob/main/MarkDown.md](https://blog.udemy.com/git-tutorial-a-comprehensive-guide/) . The guide describes snapshots: Git is a DVCS that stores data in a file system made up of snapshots. Each time you save a changed version of your project — called commit — Git creates a snapshot of the file and stores a reference to it. If the file has not changed, Git only stores a reference to the already-stored identical version of it.

# **Other Platforms & Features combined with Git**

- # **What is Version Control?**
Version Control is a system that allows you to revisit various versions of a file or set of files by recording changes. Through version control, one can revert a file or project to a previous version, track modifications and modifying individuals, and compare changes. By utilizing a Version Control System (VCS), mistakes with files can easily be rectified," (https://blog.udemy.com/git-tutorial-a-comprehensive-guide/ Git-Tutorial August 2015).

- # **What is cloning in Git?**
Per the Git-Tutorial when you create a copy of an existing Git repository from a particular server by using the clone command with a repository’s URL you have created a copy of all the files for a project. Which leads to the creation of a directory also knows as a test.

Example:              $ git clone https://github.com/test

- # **What is the command to track and stage files?**
After cloning a repository, files have tracked status and are unmodified because they have been checked out but not edited.

- # **What is the command to take a snapshot of your changed files?**

- # **What is the command to send your changed files to Github?**

- # **What is this used for?**
