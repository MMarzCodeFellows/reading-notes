# **Markdown**
In this software development process we are learning Markdown. Answering the following questions helps to explain a portion of our studies.

What is Markdown?

Why do we use Markdown?

What symbol will create a heading in Markdown?
In order to create a heading you need to add a number signs (#) in front of the word or phrase.

How many characters do you need to create the largest heading? six

How many characters do you need to create the smallest heading? one

When making text bold or italicized for emphasis, it is best practice to use which symbol?
When making bold text it is best to use two asterisks (**) or you can also use underscores (__) around the text for the best outcomes.

How do you create a link with Markdown? In order to create a hyper link in markdown you can use the following:
[Text to display](link address)

What are the three symbols you can use to create an unordered (bulleted) list with Markdown? 
You can make unordered (bulleted) lists with three symbols:

(*)
(-)
(+)

# **Growth Mindset**  
Like the gradual growth of Oklahoma City, OK, one of Code Fellows task is to have us think about growth mindset. Having a growth mindset to me is remembering how much dedication and hard work it takes others and myself to get any project, collaboration, educational milestones, and or goals accomplished. 

To stay in a growth mindset I have three reminders: I must stay focused, give myself grace, and push foward daily to stay on top of the new materials I learn.

-[x] Ask yourself what is your growth mindset

-[ ] Follow up periodically on your goals for growth mindset

-[ ] Use your growth mindset to grow your potential
