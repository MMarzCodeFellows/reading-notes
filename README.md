Having a growth mindset to me is remembering how much dedication and hard work it takes others and myself to get any project, 
collaboration, educational milestones, and or goals accomplished. 

To stay in a growth mindset I must stay focused, give myself grace, and push foward daily to stay on top of the new materials
I learn.
