# **Growth Mindset**  
Like the gradual growth of Oklahoma City, OK, one of Code Fellows task is to have us think about growth mindset. Having a growth mindset to me is remembering how much dedication and hard work it takes others and myself to get any project, collaboration, educational milestones, and or goals accomplished. 

To stay in a growth mindset I have three reminders: I must stay focused, give myself grace, and push foward daily to stay on top of the new materials I learn.

-[x] Ask yourself what is your growth mindset

-[x] Follow up periodically on your goals for growth mindset

-[x] Use your growth mindset to grow your potential
