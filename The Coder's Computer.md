Within the Terminal is what is known as the Shell. This Shell is a part of the operating system reactive to the text AKA commands you put in yuor terminal. There are numerous types of shell and ways to see what shell your terminal has. You can use one type search opportunity with a ECHO program to see what type of shell your terminal is operating with.
