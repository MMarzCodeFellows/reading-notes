# **Notes on how commands are used, and which look similar to GUI File Explorer/Finder**

+The Command Line
Per Ryan'sTutorials.Net found at https://ryanstutorials.net/linuxtutorial/commandline.php derscribes a command line is similar to a window desktop screen AKA a Terminal. 

+Basic Navigation
This system is a text feedback system. You put in text and text is rendered back in a different format. These text are in essence commands prompting a reaction to be made by typing certain text.

+About Files
Within the Terminal is what is known as the Shell. This Shell is a part of the operating system reactive to the text AKA commands you put in yuor terminal. There are numerous types of shell and ways to see what shell your terminal has. You can use one type search opportunity with a ECHO program to see what type of shell your terminal is operating with. 

# **Comparison of “Basic” Text Editor vs Coding-Specific Text Editor vs IDE **

**Text editors** are on your computer usually when purchased and they can have the bare minimum capabilities. 
For example notepad can allow for basic editing and codeing and it is up to the coder to decide for their project what will be best suited. These editors do just that they edit text. It is suggested per some to code in plain text (e.g. no italics, no bold, etc..). Most text editors don't highlight your mistakes. They are just plain text field options in a sense.

**Code Editors** as described multiple sources and the older code are more detailed ways of editing text. Visual Studio Code is a free editor made by Microsoft that helps to allow syntax, codes, highlighting, themes, and code completion.

+ Visual Studio Code, Atom, & Brackets are free text editors. 
+ BB Edit & Sublime are premium (non-free) text editors that can be purchased to help code, practice editing, highlighting, and themes in your day to day coding.
