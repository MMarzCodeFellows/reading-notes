# What is Java Script

### What is JavaScript?

Per Wikipedia.com, Javascript (JS) "is a programming language and core technology of the web, alongside HTML and CSS... 99% of clients use JavaScript on the client side for website behavior...JavaScript is a trademark of Oracle Corporation in the United States...appearing in 1995 by developer Brendan Eich," (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript edited April 18, 2024). 

Javascript is also known as a unit of code that resolves to a value. Examples x=8 and y=3+5. 

Another example of Java Script can be seen with my Github web page:

### What does it mean to declare a variable? 

Declaring variables is one of the most important concepts in JavaScript. Variables are used to store and manage data in your computer programming. To declare a variable means to create a named placeholder for data/ the place where you want to use/store data later.

Per most websites Variables are ways to store data (including https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_variables.asp). JavaScript Variables can be declared in 4 ways:

<li/> Automatically
<li/> Using var
<li/> Using let
<li/> Using const

In this first example, x, y, and z are undeclared variables.

They are automatically declared when first used:

Example
x = 5;
y = 6;
z =  x + y;

### What does it means to declare a variable we ask again? 

    Per https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_variables.asp

    The two variables price1 and price2 are declared with the const keyword.

    These are constant values and cannot be changed.

    The variable total is declared with the let keyword.

    The value total can be changed.

    When to Use var, let, or const?

    1. Always declare variables

    2. Always use const if the value should not be changed

    3. Always use const if the type should not be changed (Arrays and Objects)

    4. Only use let if you can't use const

    5. Only use var if you MUST support old browsers.

    Just Like Algebra
    Just like in algebra, variables hold values:

    let x = 5;
    let y = 6;
    Just like in algebra, variables are used in expressions:

    let z = x + y;

### What is an "assignment" operator, and what does it do? 

    In programming , an assignment operator ( = ) (for example) is used to assign a value to a variable. It is known by the equals sign =. When you use the assignment operator, you're basically telling the computer to keep/store a particular value in a variable.

    Assignment (=)
    
    The assignment (=) operator is used to assign a value to a variable or property. The assignment expression itself has a value, which is the assigned value. This allows multiple assignments to be chained in order to assign a single value to multiple variables.

### Why would we want a loop in your code?

We use a loop anytime we need repetitive action or things to be repeated multiple times. 

### When does a loop stop performing/ executing?

When the result is negative/ false.

### How many times will a while loop execute?

It will perform/ execute for as long as the execution it is performing is true. It will terminate when the execution/condition becomes false. If it never becomes false, the loop will never end. 

### Lastly What is information received from the user called?

    Per most sites, the information received from the user during a program's programming/ execution is commonly referred to as "input". In programming, input can come from numerous sources such as the mouse, keyboard, files, or other types of devices.

### Did you know###    

      JavaScript is a scripting or programming language that allows you to implement complex features on web pages — every time a web page does more than just sit there and display static information for you to look at — displaying timely content updates, interactive maps, animated 2D/3D graphics, scrolling video jukeboxes, etc. — you can bet that JavaScript is probably involved. It is the third layer of the layer cake of standard web technologies, two of which (HTML and CSS) we have covered in much more detail in other parts of the Learning Area.

    The three layers of standard web technologies; HTML, CSS and JavaScript...

    HTML is the markup language that we use to structure and give meaning to our web content, for example defining paragraphs, headings, and data tables, or embedding images and videos in the page.

    CSS is a language of style rules that we use to apply styling to our HTML content, for example setting background colors and fonts, and laying out our content in multiple columns.
    
    JavaScript is a scripting language that enables you to create dynamically updating content, control multimedia, animate images, and pretty much everything else. (Okay, not everything, but it is amazing what you can achieve with a few lines of JavaScript code).

    The three layers build on top of one another nicely. Let's take a button as an example. We can mark it up using HTML to give it structure and purpose:
