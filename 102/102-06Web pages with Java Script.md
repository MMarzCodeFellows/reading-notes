### What is JavaScript?

A unit of code that resolves to a value. Examples x=8 and y=3+5. 

### Why would we want a loop in our code?

We use a loop anytime we need repetitive action or things to be repeated multiple times. 

### When does a for loop stop performing/ executing?

When the result is negative/ false.

### How many times will a while loop execute?

It will perform/ execute for as long as the execution it is performing is true. It will terminate when the execution/condition becomes false. If it never becomes false, the loop will never end.
